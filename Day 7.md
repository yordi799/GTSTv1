# Introduction to python programming 
- programming language- is language which help us to communicate with computers.
- program- is an algorithm expressed in programming language.
- algorithm- is a detailed sequence of actions to accomplish some task.
Computers have gone through four generations. and we are now on the fifth generation, artificial intelligence. Transistor is electronic device that paved the way for the advancing of computers.
There are 3 types of programming languages: 
- low level prog language- this language is close to the hardware of computer. ex- assembly 
- high level prog language- are more close to human language such as python, java, c++
- medium level- are between high level and low level, they combine both.
There are two methods that high level languages become understood by our computer:
- compilers: are tools which help to convert the whole code to bytecode then computer will execute it
- interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line. ex python
**Python**
python is high level& interpreted programming language and very easy to learn.
some of the uses of python are- data visualization, data analysis, machine learning, hacking script writing, game development etc
- IDE-is a software that helps to write and run a specific programming language. 
Code editor- are softwares that can help to write any kind of programming language such as vs code
- Comments - are simple notes written on our codes those can help us to remember the function of the code or to to make it simple for people to understand our code 
- Python keywords- are predefined and reserved words used in python programing that have  special meaning to the compiler. ex false, pass, del and so forth.
- variables - are value holders and the process of giving value to the word is called variable declaration.
There are a lot of **data types** on python. four of them are discussed below:
- numeric data types-includes integer, float(decimals), complex numbers
- string data- is a sequence of characters represented by either a single or double coats.
- sequence data- includes lists and tuple. list is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by comma and enclosed in brackets. Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list except for tuple is immutable. 
- Dictionary data- is unordered collection of items which stores elements in key/value pairs.
