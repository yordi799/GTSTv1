**Linux for user**
**Applications in kali Linux**
1. Information gathering : it includes tools to gather information like Dmitry, maltego
2. Vulnerability analysis: tools for  finding vulnerability. In vulnerability assessment we will be given a checklist to work on or to test. its similar with penetration testing. vulnerability assessment differs from penetration testing in that penetration testing has a wider scope test. 
- proactive means penetration testing before the damage occurs. reactive is solving after the damage occurred like deleting virus 
3. web application analysis - tools to find vulnerability on websites like ZAP , WPscan 
4. Database assessment -tools for finding vulnerabilities  on data bases like Sqimap. database is a place where data of users of that application is put 
5. password attacks- tools for exploiting passwords for login, websites, application like hashcat, Johnny 
6. wireless attacks- tools for exploiting wireless systems like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth such as aircracking 
7. Reverse engineering- tools for exploiting software's, mobile application and binary files such as ghidra. it is finding weakness in the development of that software or application and trying to crack in using that vulnerability 
8. exploitation tool- tools for exploiting software, mobile, computer, websites, and any things. for example armitage
9. sniffing and spoofing- tools for listening or hijacking networks and to find private data like hamster 
10. post exploitation- tools to maintain access after the hacker gets into the system and also used to crack the password to act as admin. example- mimikatz
11. Forensics- tools for doing researches and investigate cyber attacks and for defense. example- autopsy . there are two teaming in cyber security. red teaming(offensive) are those who do penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and attack. blue teaming(forensic) defend against attack.
12. reporting tool- tools for report preparation of the data we get after the forensic like screen recording  
13. social engineering tools- tools used for social engineering 
14. system service-buttons to start some services 
15. usually used apps- basic purpose software like accessories, internet browser, office to write text, programming(vs code)
     # Linux commands
     Linux systems use shell which help us to communicate with the kernel and helps to execute code. default shell type of kali is ZSH
     shell(terminal) have five parts- username, hostname, current directory, privilege, command place . directory means folder according to Linux. Linux commands have their own options and arguments.
     **ls-l** detailed info about folders
     **ls-a** shows hidden files also
     **ls-R** give the file in every folder
     **ls-Rla** includes all the above commands 
     **cd/** take us to root directory 
     **echo 'text' >>filename** it will not delete previous files in that file or folder, it only adds 
     **rm**  removes empty file
     **rm-r** to delete folders that have files in them
     **rm-i**  for prompt 
     **cp../[old file place]../[new file place]** command if we are on another folder and we want to copy a file from home to another folder in home [..]this will change the current working directory 
     **grep-i** shows all capital and small letter words of that particular search
